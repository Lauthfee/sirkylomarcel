    <h2>Early Life: My Adoption Story ðŸ˜»!</h2>
    <p class="marg">My name is <strong>Sir Kylo Marcel Hedwig Whiskerson</strong>, I'm a purebred chocolate point himalayan (ðŸ˜Ž) born on January 23rd, 2017, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.</p>
    <p class="marg">Life for me was very hard from the beginning. Being born in the basement of a crazy old cat lady (referred to as <strong>"The witch"</strong> in the below text) who owns 13 cats, two huskies, two Shih Tzus, and 6 other hoomans whom she affectionately refers to as "kids" <em>*roll eyes*</em>, I had to struggle from the beginning to shine amongst the plethora of animals that were living with me... Bitch, I even had to struggle amongst my five siblings just to suck on my momma's titties for food! I mean, milk for God's sake... I couldn't even feed myself amongst those monsters! <em>*insert gif of sobbing cat here*</em>.
    But I had to push through, I knew my life would someday change. I kept on praying, eeeeeeeeerday, I prayed, and I prayed for that puuuuuuurfect life (see what I did there? Please laugh at my lame pun!) until one day, on a snowy Thursday evening of March 9th, I heard the bell ringing upstairs, and I instantly knew... I had the feeling this was the day I was going to be saved! I knew the laaaaawd almighty had heard my prayers, and now, my saviour is at the door.</p>

    <p class="marg">The door opened and I heard the voice of a man speaking... It was strong, confident, deep, it was a voice I had never heard before, so I wondered who it was. He greeted The Witch, then walked with confident steps across the living room... He talked for a second with her, then I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. My eyes were closed, I knew it, I knew right there and then that one of us was going to get adopted, and I prayed the heavens above it would be me. The lights turned on, the footsteps stopped, so I opened one eye, and then the other... And there it was, a very skinny silhouette standing in front of us... I was baffled for a second, how could a silhouette this small have such confident footsteps? The man walked towards us, and my siblings started meowing like a choir! I was quit, quit as a rock... Analyzing the silhouette, very intrigued, I really wanted to see who he was.</p>

    <p class="marg">He leaned and the light was on his face... SWEET MOTHER OF GOD! I know this face... It's one of those very annoying things she calls <em>"kids"</em>! I was extremely disappointed, for a second there, I felt like my chances of getting out of that basement just vanished! But the kid leaned down, and he reached to pick one of us... <em>"Oh Jesus! Not again!"</em>, I thought to myself. These little creatures have the very annoying habit of picking us up and carrying us around the house the way their mom carries her fucking drinks everywhere. But he was reaching for me! ME! Out of all my siblings, he was reaching for me... He picked me up, and I got the feeling it was for a different reason this time.
    When we went up to the living room, I finally saw him... A very handsome man, not too tall, but just tall enough, dark hair, mesmerizing eyes, with a very beautiful smile. He was dressed like a business man: black tie, dark dress shirt, a well cut suit, and what seemed to be a very expensive coat. His hair brushed to the back, his beard looked freshly trimmed... He seemed nice. I liked him right away.</p>

    <p class="marg">He opened his arms wide at the sight of me, and I knew at that moment that this beautiful hooman was there to adopt me.
    He smiled widely as he reached to grab me. He smelled good, his hands were warm although it was the middle of March, and as he pulled me closer to his chest, I could hear his heart pounding... This hooman was very excited to see me. I knew why he was there... I knew I had to charm him, I really wanted to get out of that dump, and I knew he was my only chance.
    I smiled, I meowed... I thought I could charm him with my words, so I started complimenting his ravishing looks: <em>"What a handsome man you are!"</em>, <em>"You look so debonair!"</em>, <em>"Ohh, you smell very good!"</em>, <em>"Damn, I like how white your teeth are!"</em>... But it wasn't working! For some reason, he didn't seem to understand a word I was saying! So I knew I had to resort to something else.
    I started jumping and running everywhere, showing him how fit and healthy I was! Then started rubbing my head against his hand, and he automatically started petting me! YEEEEEEEEEEEES!, there it was, I knew we could communicate with our minds, we didn't need to speak, he was finally responsive, and I was getting more and more excited!</p>

    <p class="marg">He petted me for a second, then started talking to The Witch as I stared at them with wide eyes, I tried hard to decipher what they were saying, but I couldn't! Then it all clicked in my head... If he can't understand me, I'm probably never gonna understand him as well ðŸ˜”! I was shocked, but I honestly didn't care, the connection I felt we had was stronger than words; we didn't need words to communicate, our connection was stronger than anything I had ever known before.

    <p class="marg">When the conversation ended, he gently put me down on the sofa and said goodbye! He marched right to the door and exited the house. I could see it in his eyes that he was a little sad, but I didn't understand why! Why is this hooman abandoning me? Was I not good enough for him? Did I do something wrong? I kept on meowing untill my lungs couldn't function anymore! But the kid quickly picked me up and took me back downstairs.</p>

    <p class="marg">The few following weeks were a NIGHTMARE! I couldn't believe I got that close to being adopted, but then miserably failed at charming the hooman. The days seemed long and the nights seemed cold. I kept on replaying his visit in my mind over and over, day after day. Was it something I did? Was it something I said? Am I not what he was looking for? Am I not good enough? I couldn't understand, and the pain only grew stronger each day.</p>

    <p class="marg">Until one day, on the morning of <em>Saturday April 1st, 2019</em>, I heard a knocking on the door, followed by confident footsteps marching towards the living room... I immediately knew who it was! How could I forget the man I believed to be my saviour?! I stood up, ears up sharp, tail moving quickly, I was very excited. The kid came down and picked me up, I knew this was it, this was the day I was going to leave this dump. This was the day I was going to be adopted.</p>

    <p class="marg">And I was ðŸ¥°.</p>

    <p class="marg">We got to his place, and I knew my life was going to be changed forever. The place smelled so good my nozzles were shocked... It was a definite upgrade from The Witch's basement. He opened my personal carrier and let me out. I started discovering the place. You could tell he knew I was scared, so he was following me everywhere, trying to sooth me, and it wasn't long before I started feeling at home.</p>

    <p class="marg">I mean the dude bought me a very very comfortable bed, with very classy bowls for my cereals, and a water fountain, Yes, A FREAKEN WATER FOUNTAIN ðŸ˜®. I knew I was going to have a good life.</p>

    <p class="marg">Fast-forward a few years, I can honestly say that I'm very pleased with my new life. I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely has its downs, like for real, the dude sings ALL THE FREAKEN TIME. It's like I've been adopted into a very bad remake of Glee, where the lead singer is played by a tonedeaf Broadway reject. But he loves and cares about me, so I put up with it, and it's actually cute now. Also, I didn't know hoomans worked so hard, the dude is constantly on his computer talking to people or working on some very serious stuff. I get bored when he doesn't give me much attention during the day, but from what I understand, they give him some kind of compensation for his work, and he uses it to buy things (like my amazing water fountain. cat tree, and comfortable bed...), so by all means, the dude could do 16 hours days of work for all I care, just keep them luxuries coming boo! I ain't no stray cat, I'm a fucking purebred Himalayan! *insert gif of a jetsetter cat on a yacht*. #Hashtag #NoRacismThough.</p>
    <p class="marg">It helps that I'm a cat though, it's in my nature to sleep 18 hours a day, so I do that when he's working!</p>

    <p class="marg">To keep myself busy, I opened an Instagram account, I heard this is what we do now, we take pictures and post them online, a way to show off my luxurious lifestyle, and hopefully meet some females... I mean, what can a cat do to get some pussy around here, eh?! (Please tell me you love my puns. Please.).
    Come on, follow me on Instagram, I probably already have more followers than you do, but I promise to follow back (if I notice your follow, I get at least 300 notifications a day, but don't hestitate to slide on my DMs, I read ALL of them.)! And also like my Facebook page ðŸ˜‚ (links below). I've had these accounts for some time now, and I'm already getting invites from cats in Africa asking me to help them get their money to Canada for a twenty percent commission, or share a chain of emails if I don't want to die in the next three days... Bitch, I got nine lives, it'll take you more than that to cancel me!</p>

    <p class="marg">Anyhow, all in all, I'm genuinely excited about this roommate situation I got with this hooman. He cleans, he cooks, and he even baths me... What more can a feline ask for?!</p>

    <p class="marg">My prayers have been answered, and I'm finally HAPPY!</p>
    <p class="marg">Until next time,</p>
    <p class="marg">Love you all.</p>
    <p class="marg signature">Sir Kylo Marcel Hedwig Whiskerson.</p>
